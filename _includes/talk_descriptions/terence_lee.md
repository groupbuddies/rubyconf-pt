On November 22, 2013, a devastating security exploit was publicized to the Ruby community: Heap Overflow in Floating Point Parsing CVE-2013-4164. There was no fixes provided for Ruby 1.9.2. In fact, Ruby 1.9.2 has never had a formal end of life announcement.

This talk is about my story joining ruby-core and how I've learned to interface with the rest of the core team. We'll walk through some steps and mistakes that I learned on my journey. You should care about the development of the language and I'd like to show you how you can engage without being an expert C hacker.
We'll remove the opacity around being involved and having meaningful discussions. Help us make Ruby better.
