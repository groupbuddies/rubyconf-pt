We selected some of the best restaurants in Braga, covering all price ranges.
Seats are limited, but we can always get some more depending on the interest.

A tribute to the Minho region. 'Bira' suggests the traditional dance from Minho, the 'Vira', and 'Namorados' comes from the traditional handkerchiefs of the region, 'Lenços dos Namorados'.
  It presents three concepts which are connected in order to obtain an integrated offer in a single establishment: handmade hamburgers and steaks, a regional store and a Café Concert.
