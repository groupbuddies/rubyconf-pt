To close the first day of RubyConf in style, we're throwing a big Sunset Party. We'll be serving food & drinks with a stunning view, creating the perfect chance for everyone to chill out and mingle.

We're also preparing quite a few surprises for this, so keep an eye out for
anything out of the ordinary. **Spoiler alert**: there will be music involved.
