CoderDojo is a global network of programming clubs for kids. Here, young people between 7 and 17 can learn how to code, from the basics of [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) up to fully featured languages like Ruby, and even some web development.

CorderDojo Minho takes place in the Saturday just before the conference, at the University of Minho, in Braga, and some of the staff from RubyConf PT is also actively involved. If you're thinking of enjoying some more days in Portugal and thought about bringing your kinds along, this might be worth considering.

If you're interested, all you have to do is register [here](https://coderdojo-minho.typeform.com/to/V5FMM6) (the form is in Portuguese, but you can [reach out to us](mailto:hello@rubyconf.pt) if you prefer).
