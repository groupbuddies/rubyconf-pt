Rails Girls aims to give tools and a community for women to understand technology and build their ideas. We do this by providing a great experience on building things and by making technology more approachable. Now it has arrived to Braga, just the day before RubyConf PT.
The event will finish with the Welcome Drinks for RubyConf PT, which will be at the same location.
